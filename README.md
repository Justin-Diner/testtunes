# Welcome to TestTunes

TestTunes is currently under construction. 

# Introduction
The primary goal of TestTunes is to connect artists with their fans. Artists submit their song links on TestTunes and fans are rewarded for providing reviews. The reviews can be positive or negative but should be honest.  Artists do not have to provide a finished song. In fact, artists can submit part or small portions of songs in order to receive feedback on that section.  

Fans are rewarded for leaving honest reviews. 

# Account Creation
Users are able to explore the site and listen to music without being signed up. However, they are prompted to sign in when required to do so. Once prompted, users are able to create an account, or to sign in using OAuth. There is no demo user functionality.
